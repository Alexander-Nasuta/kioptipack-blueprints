# System Setup Tutorial

```{important}
The following instructions are tailored for **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS**. If you're using a different version, please adjust accordingly.
```

```{tip}
When setting a fresh Ubuntu system, you can choose to install docker right away. Then you can skip the Docker installation step below and direktly install docker desktop after installing Conda.
```

This tutorial walks you through preparing a fresh Ubuntu Leapton system with all necessary development dependencies:
- PyCharm (IDE)
- Conda (Python environment manager)
- Docker (for containerized workflows)
- A test environment using Conda

You can follow along with the accompanying video or execute the commands directly below.

## üßæ 1. Check Your System Information

Before starting, verify your system configuration.

```bash
lsb_release -a
```

```{note}
You can also view system details under *Settings ‚Üí System ‚Üí System Details*
```

Check Current Python Installation (if any):
```bash
which python3
```
Check if Conda Is Installed
```bash
conda --version
```
Check if Docker Is Installed
```bash
docker --version
```


## üêç 2. Install Conda (Anaconda Distribution)

[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) provides a powerful environment and package manager called **Conda**, making it easy to manage Python versions, dependencies, and isolated environments.  
We‚Äôll install the full Anaconda distribution, which includes Conda, Python, and several commonly used scientific packages.

```{tip}
If you prefer a lighter setup, you can also install Miniconda instead of the full Anaconda distribution.
It provides Conda without the bundled packages and can be downloaded from [conda.io](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
```

### Navigate to your downloads folder
```bash
cd ~/Downloads
```

### Download the installer
```bash
curl -O https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2025.06-0-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
This will download the latest Anaconda installer for 64-bit Linux systems.

### Verify installer integrity
Before running the installer, verify its checksum to ensure the file wasn‚Äôt corrupted or tampered with.
Replace `<INSTALLER-FILENAME>` with the exact name of the downloaded file.

```bash
shasum -a 256 ~/Anaconda3-2025.06-0-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

```{note}
Compare the printed checksum with the value listed on the [Anaconda archive page](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/).
If they match, the installer is safe to run.
```
### Run the installer
```bash
bash ~/Anaconda3-2025.06-0-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
Follow the on-screen prompts to accept the license and choose an installation location (default is recommended).


### Refresh your terminal

To load Conda into your current shell session, either restart your terminal or run:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Test your installation
```bash
conda --version
```

### Install Anaconda Navigator dependencies
The Anaconda Navigator GUI requires some additional system libraries on Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-glx libegl1-mesa libxrandr2 libxss1 \
libxcursor1 libxcomposite1 libasound2 libxi6 libxtst6
```


## üê≥ 3. Install Docker
```{important}
The following steps follow the official Docker installation guide for Ubuntu.
These might change over time, so always refer to the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) for the most up-to-date instructions.
```

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is an essential tool for creating reproducible, isolated environments.  
It allows you to run your software, databases, or services inside containers that behave identically across systems ‚Äî making development and deployment more reliable.

In this section, you‚Äôll install and verify Docker on **Ubuntu Lapton**, following the recommended practices from the official Docker documentation.

---

## üîç Check for Existing Docker Packages

Before installing Docker, remove any unofficial or older packages that might conflict with the official version.

```bash
dpkg -l docker.io docker-doc docker-compose docker-compose-v2 podman-docker
```
If any of these packages are installed, uninstall them using:
```
sudo apt-get remove docker.io docker-doc docker-compose docker-compose-v2 podman-docker
```

Then, clean up residual dependencies:
```
sudo apt-get autoremove
```

### üß© Check Virtualization Support
Docker relies on virtualization features of your CPU to run efficiently.
To confirm that virtualization is supported and enabled:

```bash
lscpu | grep "Virtualization"
```

```{tip}
If the command shows no output, it means virtualization is not enabled.
You‚Äôll need to enable it in your BIOS or UEFI settings (usually under ‚ÄúAdvanced ‚Üí CPU Configuration‚Äù).
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Verify KVM Support
KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) enhances container performance.
Check if KVM modules are active:

```bash
lsmod | grep kvm
```
If you see no output, load the module manually:
```bash
sudo modprobe kvm
```

### üîí Check Ownership of /dev/kvm
Verify that your user has the correct permissions for virtualization:

```bash
ls -al /dev/kvm
```

If you don‚Äôt own the device or lack permission, add yourself to the kvm group:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG kvm $USER
```

```{note}
You‚Äôll need to log out and log back in (or restart your session) for this change to take effect.
```

### üß∞ Ensure QEMU Version ‚â• 5.2
Some Docker configurations rely on QEMU, especially when running virtual machines.
Update your system and install QEMU if necessary:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install qemu-system
```

### ü™Ñ Verify Init System
Ubuntu uses systemd as its init system by default, which is compatible with Docker.
You can verify this with:
```
ps --no-headers -o comm 1
```
If the output is `systemd`, you‚Äôre good to go!

### üñ•Ô∏è Check Desktop Environment
Docker Desktop requires a supported graphical environment if you plan to use it (e.g. for managing containers visually).
Check your current desktop environment:
```bash
echo $XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP
```
Supported environments include **GNOME**, **KDE**, or **MATE**.

### üîê (Optional) Install Password Manager
```{note}
This is not needed to execute the blueprints in this documentation.
```
If you plan to access private Docker registries, install a password manager like pass to securely store credentials.
```bash
sudo apt-get install pass
```

### üì¶ Set Up Docker‚Äôs Official APT Repository

Now we‚Äôll add Docker‚Äôs official repository to ensure you get the latest stable version.

1. Uninstall any old versions (if you skipped above):
```bash
sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc
```
2. Install required packages:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release
```
3. Add Docker‚Äôs GPG key:
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
```
4. Add the stable Docker repository:
```
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] \
  https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```
5. Update the package index:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

### üß™ Verify Installation
After installation, confirm that Docker is running correctly.
Check Docker version:
```bash
docker --version
```
Run the classic ‚Äúhello world‚Äù test:
```bash
sudo docker run hello-world
```
if you see the ‚ÄúHello from Docker!‚Äù message, the installation was successful.

### Install Docker Desktop
Docker Desktop provides a user-friendly interface for managing containers and images.
Follow the official guide to install Docker Desktop on Linux:
```bash
https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/
```



## üíª 4. Install PyCharm
PyCharm is a professional Python IDE developed by JetBrains, offering excellent debugging, environment management, and project tools.
Check your system architecture
```
uname -m
```
This confirms whether your machine is 64-bit (x86_64), required for PyCharm.
Visit the [JetBrains download page](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/) and choose Community (free) or Professional:

## 5. Set Up a Conda Test Environment
To verify your setup, create a simple Conda environment and run Python inside it.
### Create and activate the environment
```
conda create -n test-env python=3.11
conda activate test-env
```
### Check Python version inside Conda
```
python --version
```
You should see Python 3.11.x, confirming that Conda is managing your Python environment correctly.
