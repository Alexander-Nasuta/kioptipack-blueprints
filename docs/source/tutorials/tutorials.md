# Tutorials

The following tutorials provide a hands-on introduction to working with **KIOptiPack Blueprints** and the **FastIoT** framework.  
Each tutorial is presented as a short, follow-along video session that guides you from a defined system state to a reproducible result.

These sessions are designed for developers and researchers who want to learn how to:
- Set up a complete development environment for KIOptiPack Blueprints.
- Install and configure required software components (e.g., Docker, MongoDB, and Python environments).
- Run and extend Machine Learning services using the **FastIoT** microservice architecture.

## Tutorial Structure

Each video builds upon the previous one and represents a clearly defined step in the setup and development process.  
Every tutorial starts from a known system state and ends in a verifiable state that can be checked via terminal commands or showcasing the expected output.

This modular approach allows you to:
- Follow along from the very beginning (starting from a fresh Ubuntu installation)
- Jump directly to a specific topic or configuration step.
